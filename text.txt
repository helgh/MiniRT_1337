translation matrix ==>  transformation thats moves a point, it changes the cordonates of the point by adding to or subtracting from them.

if take inverse of translation matrix we can get translation matrix thats moves points in reverse

multiplying a translation matrix by a vector should not change the vector!

when multiplied translation matrix by a vector, the 0 in w causes those translation values to disappear

translation matrix structred :

[1  0  0  x]
[0  1  0  y]
[0  0  1  z]
[0  0  0  1]

scaling matrix ==>   scaling moves points by multiplication, when applied to an object centered at the origin, this transformation scales all points on the object,
						effectively making it larger (if the scale value is greater than 1) or smaller (if the scale value is less than 1), as shown in the figure.

unlike translation, scaling applies to vectors as well changing their length

multiplying a tuple by the inverse of a scaling matrix will scale the tuple in the oppsite way.

Reflection is essentially the same thing as scaling by a negative value.

scaling matrix structred :

[x  0  0  0]
[0  y  0  0]
[0  0  z  0]
[0  0  0  1]

rotation matrix ==>   multiplying a tuple by a rotation matrix around an axis will rotate that tuple around an axis.

Rotation matrices depend on the sine and cosine functions from trigonometry.

The rotation will appear to be clockwise around the corresponding axis when viewed along that axis.
